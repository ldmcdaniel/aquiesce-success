title: "Organize music collection by tonality and meter for maximum playability"
---

If you organize your music collection by tonality, such as G major, you have a great way
to practice your scales and chord changes with different songs that you can jam with.
It is also a good way to practice improvisation and transcription.

If you organize your music collection also by meter, you have a collection of songs tailored to 
a certain meter (duple, triple, mixed).  It makes practicing transcription and rhythm syllables
easier when practicing alone.

Both of these methods are missing from the musical giants that are Apple Music and Spotify.
We are in the age of the most available music at all times and no one has an idea not only of the
tonality, key, meter, chord progression, syncopated rhythm, or harmonic texture is expressed around us.
We have lost our ability to say why we like the musical aspects of a piece of music other than feeling,
which is abstract but nonetheless important, but does little to describe the structure of the accompanying
music by itself.

Organizing music in this manner brings about a environment that a modern music listener can dial up on
our favorite music services in our custom playlists that we made over time to provide a B*b* minor triple meter
playlist to suite our sadness more effectively, or a G major duple playlist to express our thankfulness and
gratitude.  And you can jam with it and tap into the fairly modern invention, compared to our planet's age,
in a structured and intelligent manner.  I can show you the door, but you must walk through it.
