title: "The space between the beat determines tempo, not speed!"
---

It is really the space between beats that determines tempo, whether fast or slow, beats are long and short.
It is sometimes hard to perceive space, based on your relative proximity to everything hiding everything about
anything in particular.  But once this awareness of space in rhythmic proximity is has one been made aware about,
true feeling in rhythm finally happens.  Slow becomes not open and boring, but moving and with momentum.
Fast becomes the race between two points efficiently and not a battle of might, but efficiency.  When this happens,
rhythm becomes a painting with not only different sounds, but different intensities between the sounds.
Like you are always told, listen to the sound between the beat.  Well, this is what they meant, put into
description.  Read it and become your destiny.
